Project Title: Identifying The Fake News Using Machine Learning

Team Members ‘Names: Sowmya Kasu, Prokshith Perni.



Executive Summary: 
The rise of fake news poses a serious challenge to democracy, journalism, and public confidence, especially in the realm of political discourse. This project seeks to develop a robust model for detecting fake news articles, leveraging sophisticated machine learning techniques to address the spread of misinformation. The main goal is to create a system that not only assesses the authenticity of news but also evaluates the probability of a story being false, empowering users to make well-informed decisions.
This project is significant because it has the potential to strengthen trust in media and help people make better decisions based on trustworthy information. By equipping users with tools to spot misleading news stories, the project aims to promote a healthier flow of information in society. The expected outcomes include a dependable model for telling real news from fake, as well as valuable insights into the traits that define misleading content. Ultimately, this research aspires to raise awareness and build resilience against the spread of fake news, empowering individuals to navigate the information landscape more effectively.


Project Background:
As misinformation increasingly threatens the foundations of democracy and erodes public trust, our organization has taken on the critical challenge of combating the pervasive spread of fake news, particularly within the political landscape. At the start of this project, we understood that misinformation could easily sway public opinion and damage the credibility of news sources. To tackle this challenge, we aim to develop a model that not only identifies fake news but also assesses how likely a story is to be misleading. By harnessing advanced machine learning techniques, our goal is to empower individuals to make informed decisions based on reliable information. 
Ultimately, we hope to foster a healthier information ecosystem where people can navigate the complexities of news with greater confidence and awareness.


Business Objectives:
The primary objective of this project is to enhance customer trust by providing reliable tools for identifying fake news, thereby empowering individuals to make informed decisions based on accurate information. From a business perspective, the goal is to retain current customers by actively addressing their concerns about misinformation and its impact on their media consumption. Additionally, we aim to predict potential customer churn by analyzing patterns that indicate when users may be tempted to turn to competitors offering similar services. By focusing on these objectives, we seek not only to solidify our existing customer base but also to establish our organization as a leader in the fight against misinformation. This proactive approach will help us enhance customer loyalty and attract new users who value credibility and transparency in news reporting.

Business Success Criteria: 
To determine the success of this project from a business perspective, we will focus on several key criteria. First, we aim to reduce customer churn by 15% within the first year, measuring retention through feedback and satisfaction surveys. We also hope to see a 20% increase in user engagement, indicated by more frequent interactions with our misinformation detection tools. Positive user feedback is crucial, with a goal of at least 80% of users reporting that our tools help them identify fake news more effectively. Additionally, we aspire to establish our organization as a leader in combating misinformation, which will be gauged through media mentions and partnerships. Lastly, we want to gain valuable insights into user behavior, with our analytics team analyzing trends to continually refine our offerings. Meeting these criteria will not only strengthen customer trust and loyalty but also position us as an essential resource in the fight against fake news.
